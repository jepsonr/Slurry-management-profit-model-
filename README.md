# Slurry-management-profit-model
Input: revenue - (international &amp; domestic prices &amp; purity), quality of raw ore; Costs - water, electricity (by tier), other costs. 
Output: mixture and rate of slurry that maximizes profit while not overloading equipment or choke points.

Genesis:
The newly promoted general manager of an iron mill was faced with a number of challeges left to him when the previous manager quit:
  1. The flotation tanks were constantly breaking down from overload
  2. The EPA had filed injunctions because the tailing's moisture content was damgerously high
  3. The SAG mill kept breaking down from improper regulation of volumetric flow and imbalance of feed (raw ore and water)
  4. Prices and purity requirements on foreign and domestic markets required different SAG mill speeds and feed rates
  5. Density samples took several hours to analyze which left too much lag-time for contenuous slurry flow management
  
  6. One solution was to install millions of dollars of sensors and suffer hundreds of hours of down time
  7. The other solution was to develop a mathematical model and statistical analysis tool that calculated and prediced the most      efficient mill operational speeds 

The plan:
  1. Predict grinding material consumption rates
  2. Develop a system of equations to calculate and manage the flow of slurry to prevent damaging equipment
