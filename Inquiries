//Ore feed is in tons per hour
//water input is in gal per min

Questions and Investigation Notes:
1. What are the dimensions of P∙s  (percent of dry solids in the liquid times Specific gravity of the slurry)?
 	 P∙s=%∙g/ml=? the volume of dry solids which requires the known G of the dry solids.
	This raises a follow on question. Isn’t the G of the underflow that doesn’t pass through the shaker screen lower than the G of the that does pass

2. What are the dimensions of G (specific gravity of the dry solids)?
	=grams/ml

3. Can the G be calculated mathematically without using a Marcy scale?


4. Can s.g. be calculated using P and s?


5. Does the system of equations for slurry flow work? 


6. Can the dilution ratio D be used as a coefficient for the system of equations?


7. Could a combination of ρ,G,s,P be used in a system of equations that would yield the same flow rates?


8. Can the values ρ,G,s,P,D be estimated or calculated (based on the ratio of low and high grade crushed ore and feed rates of water at various stages of refinement)?


9. Why does P change between the SAG Mill discharge and the SAG Cyclone Feed (approximately from 70% to 55%)?
	Assumptions: Additional water dilution. Two sumps feed into the shaker screen, new water goes to SAG Mill.

10. Where does the water from the sumps come from?
	Assumptions: reclaimed from drying process.

11. What is the Vp (Volumetric Loading =? % of total volume [total volume of what, the mill?]) which is the variable for the circulating load calculation.


12. Is the SAG/Ball Mill feed talking about tons of slurry or crushed ore per hour?


13. Is the SAG Mill discharge the same as the slurry going into the SAG Mill Discharge Pumpbox?

14. Does the equation P_F∙G_F=P_U∙G_U+P_B∙G_B hole.
